The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis. 
R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages. 
We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials 
is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing: 
breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.


Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.
